                        <p>We have well equipped laboratories, with customized equipment to cater to the requirements of different curricula and scholars of different age groups. In addition to the Physics, Chemistry and Biology Labs, there are separate Robotics and Computer Labs as well.<br>The Laboratories are designed keeping in mind the materials being used, safety regulations and ventilation systems. They are spacious and have provision for conducting lectures as well. Lab classes are an integral part of all the curriculums offered at MCS, with every class having at least one lab period per week. During Lab classes, scholars learn the skills of handling apparatus, data collection, interpretation and conclusion. They also learn about Lab etiquette with a special focus on safety. Safety rules are prominently displayed in the rooms and scholars and teachers are required to follow them at all times.

                    <h3>Physics Lab</h3>
                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>Mayoor Chopasni has a well planned Physics lab that equips the students to have hands on experience. It is adequately equipped with every kind of modern apparatus required for the AISSE Practical Examinations as prescribed by the CBSE. The gauges equipped tables used as student workstations allow multiple arrangements and combinations for laboratory work and small-group activities. The equipment ranges from the commonly found lens, magnet, beam balance, spring balance, glass prism to the advanced apparatus like Vernier calipers, Screw guage, Spherometer, Searl’s apparatus, Helical spring, Newton’s cooling kit, Sonometer, Resonance tube, Meter Bridge, Potentiometer, Galvanometer, Battery eliminator, voltmeter, ammeter and resistors and spectrometers to name a few. The laboratory is also equipped with an Interactive board that allows the teachers to incorporate the latest technology in their lessons to arouse the interest and curiosity of the students.</p>

                    <h3>Chemistry Lab</h3>
                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>Popping sounds, coloured fumes and regular pungent smell is the order of the day in the well equipped chemistry lab where the students experiment with various chemical reactions. We have an ultra modern lab fully equipped with latest apparatus to provide the much needed facilities to the students and proves to be a platform for the inquisitive minds. All the experiments are carried out under vigilance. We maintain the quality of the chemicals and the branded instruments. Our spacious, well ventilated Chemistry Lab caters to the requirement of students.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h3>Biology Lab</h3>
                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>Mayoor Chopasni has an intricately designed Biology Laboratory planned to meet the demands of the advancement in science and technology. The laboratory apparatus ranges from simple slides, test-tube, petri dishes, Bunsen burners, beakers and flasks to the composite microscopes of varying powers to observe samples and organisms closely. They are high-powered, extremely expensive, and sensitive pieces of equipment that can make even the smallest parts of a single cell seem clear. Besides, the lab is self sufficient with other necessary assets such as hot case, refrigerator and water bath etc. Besides the aforesaid the laboratory also has charts, models and specimens meant for demonstrations. The staff keep at Mayoor Chopasni the latest syllabus in mind the models, specimens, charts, chemicals etc have been well planned. The well qualified teachers and lab assistants are yet another asset for the lab.</p>

                    <h3>Robotics Lab</h3>
                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>The trend-setting Robotics lab at Mayoor Chopasni was one of the first in the country with its advanced facilities designed to enable the students to learn at an early age, encouraging them to become future robotic engineers. To generate interest step by step, the junior and senior classes learn the basics by making models with the help of Arduino Kits. As they grow, students become more confident of their inclinations towards the robotic field and begin to learn how to make robots from scratch, cutting and bending moulds from plastic sheets and even designing their own PCBs. Models made by students are kept on display in the Lab, as a source of encouragement to other students and to instill a sense of pride in those who created them. The Robotics Laboratory also sends many of its best robots to school- and college-level competitions and has won the school many accolades.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h3>Computer Lab</h3>
                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>Our classrooms are equipped with digital teaching systems powered by a Knowledge Centre, which is backed by a digital content library of plenty of modules of curriculum-mapped, multimedia-rich and 3D content. The Centre endeavours to consistently enhance the professional and soft skills of our teachers through a well-developed, teacher and pedagogy training module. A full-fledged computer laboratory at Mayoor Chopasni enables student-led workshops and offers them hands-on ICT knowledge. It equips the students with easy access to the latest in the field of technology, including multimedia computers and Internet. Each theme picked at a level of study is also integrated with the computer studies programme offered at the School. Students are trained in TuxPaint, MySQL, Word Processing, Java Programming, Web Designing and other softwares to work on projects and assignments.</p>
